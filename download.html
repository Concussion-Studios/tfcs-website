				<h2>Full Package Download</h2>
				<p>This is not the recommended method. In fact, we currently don't have a full package to provide. This won't be made until we're at a full beta release or a final public release as a sourcemod.</p>

				<h2>Steam Release</h2>
				<p>This will be the most up-to-date and default method once we're finally released fully and approved by Valve for a Steam release. Since that hasn't happened yet, our Steam build is currently private.</p>
